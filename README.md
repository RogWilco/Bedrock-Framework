Bedrock is designed to be something more than the multitude of PHP frameworks
out there. It comes packed with all the essentials: an MVC architecture, a basic
ORM, and a simplistic templating system. But its goal is for something
greater: bringing all those disparate APIs into one accessible and friendly
framework.
