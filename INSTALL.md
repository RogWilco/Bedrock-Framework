## Automated Installation

Since version 0.1.1, automated installation of the framework is possible using
the included installer application. To start the installation process, simply
direct a browser to the framework's web root (under "pub/" by default). You
should automatically be redirected to the installer start page (provided an
application configuration file does not exist under "cfg/application.xml").

If you cannot access the installer using the above method, try navigating to
the installer start page directly by browsing to the location
"install/index.php" under your public root ("pub/install/index.php").

Follow the instructions and provide the requested information on each page.
When the installation has completed, remove the "install/" directory before
making your application publicly accessible.

## Manual Installation

Manual installation instructions will be added at a later date.
