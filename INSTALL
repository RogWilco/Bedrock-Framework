I. AUTOMATED INSTALLATION

 Since version 0.1.1, automated installation of the framework is possible using
 the included installer application. To start the installation process, simply
 direct a browser to the framework's web root (under "pub/" by default). You
 should automatically be redirected to the installer start page (provided an
 application configuration file does not exist under "cfg/application.xml").
 
 If you cannot access the installer using the above method, try navigating to
 the installer start page directly by browsing to the location
 "install/index.php" under your public root ("pub/install/index.php").
 
 Follow the instructions and provide the requested information on each page.
 When the installation has completed, remove the "install/" directory before
 making your application publicly accessible.

II. MANUAL INSTALLATION

 Manual installation instructions will be added at a later date.
