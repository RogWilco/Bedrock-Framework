 Maintenance release, fixing some minor bugs related to the installer.

 BUGS:
     - Fixed bug with logger settings not being saved during installation.

       generated source files and configuration settings.

 model layer data and structure. Additoin of some communication services as well
 as the expansion of the data API.

       exporting data and structure.
     - Changed the current implementation of the logger to use "target" classes
       instead of "output streams."

       third-party support to the logger.

       directory structure.
